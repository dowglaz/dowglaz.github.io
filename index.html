Hi! It's my personal page on github!<br>
Soon I'll redesign this page to be my personal page for computer science and math contents!! =D<br>
This is the link to my personal project (in university) in Java with Oracle: dowglaz.github.com/Projeto-labbd. This is an open-source project and I will change this to make a persistence API (like hibernate). It's just for fun!

Seeya!
